# Sound Relayer
A way to transfer sound from one device's microphone into another device.

## USING
- Instal GNUMake (Conviniency)
- Run `$ make setup`
- Run `$ make`

## TODO
- We might be able to create a faster server by implementing the Server with GO
- A better message data (NOT USING JSON, maybe with ByteBuffer)
